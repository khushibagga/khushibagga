## Legal Standards

Modern legal systems are beginning to adapt to AI-driven tools — from automated hiring to predictive policing. Frameworks for liability, fairness, and accountability are still developing.

## Precedents

While laws haven’t fully caught up, courts are referencing traditional principles like *duty of care*, *negligence*, and *vicarious liability* to handle emerging cases involving AI.

## High-Profile Cases

Some recent court cases have sparked debate about responsibility when algorithms make decisions with real-world consequences — especially in finance, healthcare, and criminal justice.

Re: Liability in Algorithmic Decision-Making

Summary:
Where an AI system is used to make decisions that significantly affect individuals (e.g., hiring, lending, or sentencing), legal responsibility may lie with the party who deployed or profited from the system, even if they did not develop it directly.

Key Considerations:
- Foreseeability of harm
- Transparency of the model
- Availability of human oversight`,

The above example shows a simplified decision logic for assessing legal liability — whether it lies with the developer, deployer, or decision-maker. The real legal test, of course, involves far more nuance.
